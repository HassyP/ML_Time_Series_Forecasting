# Energy Consumption Forecasting with XGBoost

This project demonstrates the use of XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting algorithm, for time series forecasting of energy consumption. The steps involved include data loading, train-test splitting, feature creation, and model development.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Data Exploration:** The project starts with data visualization to understand energy consumption patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Time series features like hour, day of the week, and more are created to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** An XGBoost regression model is trained on the training data.
- **Feature Importance:** Feature importance is analyzed to understand the drivers of energy consumption.
- **Model Evaluation:** The model's performance is evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Error Analysis:** The project includes error analysis to identify best and worst predicted days.
